# Holt-Winter-Exponential-Smoothing
This task was a part of my quantitative research virtual experience at JP Morgan Chase

## Objective
We have a sample time series data of natural gas prices. Each point in the data set corresponds to the purchase price of natural gas at the end of a month, from 31st October 2020 to 30th September 2024. Lets analyze the data and see if we can extrapolate it for one year into the future.

## Scope for Improvement
Our forecast only has month end data points. Our data and forecast would be more useful for traders if we could give them data on daily frequency. To achieve this we can fit a sin curve on our data. I'll leave this task for the readers.
